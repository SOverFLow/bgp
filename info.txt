- VXLAN is a network virtualization technology that allows you to create Layer 2 
networks over a Layer 3 infrastructure. 
It is commonly used in data centers to extend Layer 2 
segments across multiple physical locations

- The goal of part 2 is to create a VXLAN network that can communicate between two machines

- VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a network virtualization technology that encapsulates Layer 2 
Ethernet frames within Layer 3 UDP packets.

- It allows you to create virtual Layer 2 networks (like VLANs) over a Layer 3 network (like IP).

- VXLAN is often used in data centers to extend Layer 2 segments across multiple physical locations,

- Why use VXLAN?

- Scalability: Traditional VLANs are limited to 4096 unique IDs (12-bit VLAN ID). 
VXLAN uses a 24-bit segment ID, allowing for up to 16 million unique VXLAN segments.

- Flexibility: VXLAN allows you to extend Layer 2 networks across Layer 3 boundaries, which is useful in cloud environments where virtual machines (VMs) need to be moved between different physical servers.

- Isolation: VXLAN provides network isolation similar to VLANs but with greater scalability.

- How does VXLAN work?
- Encapsulation: VXLAN encapsulates Layer 2 Ethernet frames into UDP packets.
 The original Ethernet frame is wrapped in a VXLAN header,
  which includes a 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) to identify the VXLAN segment.

- VTEP (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint): This is the device that performs the encapsulation and decapsulation
 of VXLAN packets. It can be a physical switch, 
 a virtual switch, or a software-based endpoint.

- Multicast or Unicast: VXLAN can use multicast or unicast to transport the
 encapsulated packets. In this project, you will start with static configuration 
 and then move to dynamic multicast.


- A bridge is a virtual switch that connects multiple network interfaces together.

You will create a bridge (br0) and attach the VXLAN interface to it.

The bridge will allow the VXLAN to communicate with the Ethernet interfaces.

Machine 1 (VTEP):

# Create a bridge
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up

# Create a VXLAN interface with VNI 10
ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 local 192.168.1.1 dstport 4789
ip link set vxlan10 up

# Attach the VXLAN interface to the bridge
ip link set vxlan10 master br0

# Configure Ethernet interface (e.g., eth1)
ip link set eth1 up
ip link set eth1 master br0

Machine 2 (VTEP):

# Create a bridge
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up

# Create a VXLAN interface with VNI 10
ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 local 192.168.1.2 dstport 4789
ip link set vxlan10 up

# Attach the VXLAN interface to the bridge
ip link set vxlan10 master br0

# Configure Ethernet interface (e.g., eth1)
ip link set eth1 up
ip link set eth1 master br0

Dynamic Multicast Configuration:
In the second part of this task, you will configure the VXLAN to use dynamic multicast
. This means that the VTEPs will use multicast groups to discover each other automatically.

Multicast Group: You will configure the VXLAN to use a multicast group (e.g., 239.1.1.1).

Automatic Discovery: The VTEPs will join the multicast group and automatically discover each other.

Example Configuration for Multicast:
# Create a VXLAN interface with multicast group 239.1.1.1
ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 group 239.1.1.1 dstport 4789


- GNS3 is a network simulation tool that allows you to emulate real network devices 
(routers, switches, etc.) and create complex network topologies. It uses virtualization 
to run network operating systems (like Cisco IOS)
 and connect them in a simulated environment.

 - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol used to exchange routing 
 information between different autonomous systems (AS) on the internet. It is the protocol that makes 
 the internet work by determining the best paths for data to travel between networks.

 - Layer 2 (Data Link Layer): Deals with MAC addresses and switches.
  It is responsible for node-to-node communication (e.g., Ethernet).

- Layer 3 (Network Layer): Deals with IP addresses and routers. 
It is responsible for end-to-end communication across multiple networks.

- What is a packet routing software?

Packet routing software (like Zebra or Quagga) is used to manage routing protocols on a network device.
 It allows the device to determine the best path for data packets to travel.

 - What is the OSPFD service?

- OSPFD is the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) daemon. It is used for routing within an autonomous system
 (intra-AS routing) and uses a link-state routing algorithm.

 - What is a VXLAN, and how is it different from a VLAN?

VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a network virtualization technology that extends Layer 2 networks 
over Layer 3 infrastructure using encapsulation. Unlike VLANs,
 which are limited to 4096 IDs, VXLAN supports up to 16 million unique segments.

 - What is a switch?

 - A switch is a network device that operates at Layer 2 and forwards data based on MAC addresses.

 - What is a bridge?

- A bridge is a virtual switch that connects multiple network interfaces together, 
allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same physical network.

- What is the difference between broadcast and multicast?

 - Broadcast: Sends data to all devices in a network segment.

- Multicast: Sends data to a specific group of devices that have joined a multicast group.

- Explain the expected operation of the topology in the subject.

- The topology involves setting up a VXLAN network with two VTEPs (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints) 
that communicate over a Layer 3 network. 
The VXLAN ID is 10, and the network should allow communication between the two machines.

- What is the difference between static and dynamic multicast in VXLAN?

- Static: Manually configured VTEPs.

- Dynamic Multicast: VTEPs automatically discover each other using multicast groups


Why This is Important in the Project:

VXLAN allows devices in different physical or virtual networks to behave as if they’re
 on the same Layer 2 domain.

 - Why Relevant to Part 2:

- The FRR container simulates a switch by bridging Ethernet and VXLAN interfaces.

In this project:
Bridge interfaces in the FRR container connect VXLAN tunnels to the local Ethernet segment.

- Broadcast:

Sends data to all devices in a network.
Example: ARP request (“Who has IP X?”).
Inefficient for large networks since all devices must process the message.
- Multicast:

Sends data only to devices that have joined a specific multicast group.
Example: VXLAN uses multicast for distributing broadcast and unknown unicast traffic across VTEPs.

Why Relevant to VXLAN:

Multicast ensures efficient distribution of VXLAN BUM traffic (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast).
